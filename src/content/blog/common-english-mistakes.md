## Subject-Verb Agreement

<div class="grammar-section">
One of the fundamental rules in English is that the subject and verb must agree in number. This means singular subjects need singular verbs, and plural subjects need plural verbs.

<div class="example-incorrect">
 ‚ùå <strong>Incorrect:</strong>
- He play football every weekend.
- The students in my class is very smart.
</div>

<div class="example-correct">
‚úÖ <strong>Correct:</strong>
- He plays football every weekend.
- The students in my class are very smart.

<strong>Why?</strong> In the present simple tense:
- Singular subjects (he/she/it) use verb + s
- Plural subjects use the base form of the verb
</div>
</div>

## Article Usage

<div class="grammar-section">
Articles (a, an, the) are often challenging for Vietnamese speakers since Vietnamese doesn't have an equivalent system.

<div class="example-incorrect">
 ‚ùå <strong>Incorrect:</strong>
- I bought ‚àÖ new phone yesterday.
- She is ‚àÖ best student in class.
</div>

<div class="example-correct">
‚úÖ <strong>Correct:</strong>
- I bought a new phone yesterday.
- She is the best student in class.

<strong>Why?</strong>
- Use "a/an" for singular countable nouns when mentioning something for the first time
- Use "the" when referring to something specific or already mentioned
</div>

<div class="tip-card">
üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Think of "the" as pointing to something specific, like when you point at something with your finger. If you can point at it specifically, you probably need "the".
</div>
</div>

## Preposition Usage

<div class="grammar-section">
Prepositions in English often don't match directly with their Vietnamese counterparts.

<div class="example-incorrect">
 ‚ùå <strong>Incorrect:</strong>
- I will arrive to the airport at 3PM.
- He is good in playing guitar.
</div>

<div class="example-correct">
‚úÖ <strong>Correct:</strong>
- I will arrive at the airport at 3PM.
- He is good at playing guitar.

<strong>Common Patterns:</strong>
- arrive at (a specific place)
- good at (a skill)
- different from (not different than/to)
- depend on (not depend in/at)
</div>
</div>

## Tense Usage

<div class="grammar-section">
English has a more complex tense system compared to Vietnamese, which often leads to confusion.

<div class="example-incorrect">
 ‚ùå <strong>Incorrect:</strong>
- I live in Hanoi since 2010.
- When I arrived home, she already left.
</div>

<div class="example-correct">
‚úÖ <strong>Correct:</strong>
- I have lived in Hanoi since 2010.
- When I arrived home, she had already left.

<strong>Key Points:</strong>
- Use present perfect for actions starting in the past and continuing to now
- Use past perfect for actions completed before another past action
</div>
</div>

## Countable vs Uncountable Nouns

<div class="grammar-section">
Understanding whether a noun is countable or uncountable affects article usage and verb agreement.

<div class="example-incorrect">
 ‚ùå <strong>Incorrect:</strong>
- I need some informations about the course.
- I would like to buy a furniture for my room.
</div>

<div class="example-correct">
‚úÖ <strong>Correct:</strong>
- I need some information about the course.
- I would like to buy a piece of furniture for my room.

<strong>Common Uncountable Nouns:</strong>
- information
- furniture
- advice
- knowledge
- homework
- research
</div>
</div>
